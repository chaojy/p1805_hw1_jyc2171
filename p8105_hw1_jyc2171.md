### This is my solution to Problem 1.

#### Data frame comprised of the specified elements is as below:

``` r
US_states_df = 
  tibble(
     Sample = rnorm(10),
     Sample_gt_0 = Sample > 0,
     States = c("New York", "California", "Rhode Island", "Maine", "Missouri", "Connecticut", 
                "New Jersey", "Pennsylvania", "Washington", "South Dakota"),
     Time_zone = factor(c("Eastern", "Pacific", "Eastern", "Eastern", "Central", "Eastern",                                 "Eastern", "Eastern", "Pacific", "Central")),
)
US_states_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    Sample Sample_gt_0 States       Time_zone
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>        <fct>    
    ##  1 -0.276 FALSE       New York     Eastern  
    ##  2  0.903 TRUE        California   Pacific  
    ##  3  1.74  TRUE        Rhode Island Eastern  
    ##  4  0.911 TRUE        Maine        Eastern  
    ##  5 -0.341 FALSE       Missouri     Central  
    ##  6 -0.765 FALSE       Connecticut  Eastern  
    ##  7 -0.885 FALSE       New Jersey   Eastern  
    ##  8  0.790 TRUE        Pennsylvania Eastern  
    ##  9 -0.917 FALSE       Washington   Pacific  
    ## 10  0.633 TRUE        South Dakota Central

#### Next, I try to take the mean of each variable.

``` r
mean(pull(US_states_df, Sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.1789284

``` r
mean(pull(US_states_df, Sample_gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(US_states_df, States))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(US_states_df, States)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(US_states_df, Time_zone))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(US_states_df, Time_zone)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

#### I can take the mean of numbers and logical but not character or factor.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(US_states_df, Sample))
as.numeric(pull(US_states_df, Sample_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(US_states_df, States))
as.numeric(pull(US_states_df, Time_zone))
```

#### Number, logical, and factor variables can be converted to numbers. Character variables cannot be converted to numbers.

#### Next, I convert variables from one type to another as specified:

``` r
as.numeric(pull(US_states_df, Sample_gt_0)) * pull(US_states_df, Sample)
as.factor(pull(US_states_df, Sample_gt_0)) * pull(US_states_df, Sample)
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(US_states_df, Sample_gt_0))) * pull(US_states_df, Sample)
```

#### The logical converted to numeric ranges from 0 to 1. The product is numbers.

#### The logical converted to factor yields “TRUE” or “FALSE”. The product is not meaningful.

#### The logical converted to factor, then converted to numeric ranges from 1 to 2 (instead of 0 to 1 for some reason). The product is numbers.

### This is my solution to Problem 2.

#### Loading the downloaded “Penguins” dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### This dataset appears to be a data frame consisting of 8 columns and 344 rows. There are three factor variables indicating the species, island (of origin?), and biologic sex of the penguins.

#### There are three types of species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.

#### There are three types of islands: Biscoe, Dream, and Torgeren

#### The length (in millimeters), mass (in grams), and year are integer variables.

#### The bill length (millimeters) and bill depth (millimeters) are also numbers and appear to be to the tenths decimal place. There are missing data as indicated by “NA” in various fields. The mean flipper length is NA.

Next, I make a scatterplot of flipper length and bill length with color
points defined by species. The first step is creating the data frame.

``` r
scatterplot_df = tibble(
  x = pull(penguins, bill_length_mm),
  y = pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm),
  z = pull(penguins, species)
)
```

Next, I will generate the scatterplot:

``` r
plot = ggplot(scatterplot_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) + geom_point()
```

## I did not do this for the last homework\! Save ggplot export

``` r
ggsave(
  "plot.pdf"
 )
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
